Constructor Hangman Pseudocode: 

1. User Input -- Want to Play?? Yes or No.

2. If Yes, pull randomized, hidden word (hidden with dashes)

array of words = random number 

how many letters = how many dashes --> count how many letter --> 
that many dashes display (.join), index of letter = index of dashes [i]

indexOf letter (parameter) index must be > -1 is match, if not, no match 

if # guesses >= 0 <--inquire prompt, else game over 

3. User guesses letter. If right, letter displays. If wrong, decreases their remaining guesses
 and prompts them to guess again. 

4. If run of guesses, game ends.

5. If word guessed within number of guesses, advance to the next word until no more words and guesses remain.
